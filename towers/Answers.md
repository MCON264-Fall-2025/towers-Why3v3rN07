#  MCON 264 — Recursion Assignment: Towers of Hanoi × 3


##  Overview

In this lab, you implemented three recursive versions of the Towers of Hanoi problem and (optionally) one iterative version.  
Each part reinforces a key concept of recursion — base case, recursive case, and growth pattern — and illustrates how recursion can be refactored or replaced by iteration.

---

## Part 1 — Classic Towers of Hanoi (`TowersOfHanoi.java`)

### 1. Base Case
_Describe the base condition that stops recursion (for example, what happens when `n == 0`?)._

> ✎ Your answer here

### 2. Recursive Case
_Explain the sequence of recursive calls and what each represents._

> ✎ Your answer here

### 3. Sample Trace (for n = 3)

| Move # | From | To |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 1 | A | C |
| 2 | A | B |
| 3 | C | B |
| … |  |  |

_Total moves = 2ⁿ − 1 = 7 (for n = 3)_

---

## Part 2 — Counting Moves (`TowersExercise21.java`)

### 1. Approach
_How did you modify the standard recursion to count rather than print moves?_

>  Your answer here

### 2. Verification of Formula
_Complete the table and verify that count = 2ⁿ − 1._

| n | Expected (2ⁿ − 1) | Program Output | Matches? (Y/N) |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 1 | 1 |  |  |
| 2 | 3 |  |  |
| 3 | 7 |  |  |
| 4 | 15 |  |  |
| 5 | 31 |  |  |

### 3. Reflection
_What changes when you replace printed moves with a counter? What are the pros and cons?_

> ✎ Your answer here

---

## Part 3 — Hanoi Variation (`TowersVariations.java`)

### 1. New Rule
_Every move must pass through the middle peg. How does this alter the recursion?_

> ✎ Your answer here

### 2. Observed Move Counts

| n | Expected ≈ 3ⁿ − 1 | Program Output | Matches? (Y/N) |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 1 | 2 |  |  |
| 2 | 8 |  |  |
| 3 | 26 |  |  |
| 4 | 80 |  |  |

### 3. Analysis
_Why does this variation grow faster than the standard version? How do additional move constraints affect complexity?_

> ✎ Your answer here

## Comparative Analysis

### 1. Growth Patterns

| Version | Approx. Formula | Growth Type |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Standard | 2ⁿ − 1 | Exponential |
| Variation | 3ⁿ − 1 | Exponential (faster) |
| Iterative (Optional) | 2ⁿ − 1 | Same as recursive but loop based |

### 2. Stack Depth and Memory
_Estimate the maximum recursion depth before StackOverflowError and discuss how stack size (–Xss flag) affects this._

## Part 4 — Beyond Recursion (Extra Credit)

### Iterative / Explicit-Stack Version (`TowersIterative.java`)

1. How does your iterative version simulate recursion?
2. How did you track pending calls or frames?
3. Which version (r vs iterative) is clearer? Why?

> ✎ Your answer here

---

## Discussion &amp; Reflection

1. What three questions can you use to verify a recursive solution works?
2. How do the base case and recursive case cooperate to guarantee termination?
3. What is the trade-off between elegance and efficiency in recursion?
